"""Make a cut's audio one channel configuration by re-encoding only the
frames that disagree.

Broadcast AAC can change channel configuration mid-programme - Channel 4 HD
runs continuity and advert breaks in stereo and the programme in 5.1.  MPEG-TS
carries the configuration in every frame so a mixed cut plays perfectly, but
MP4 and Matroska each hold ONE configuration per track, so copying such a cut
into either gives a track with the right packet count and no sound.

The blunt answer is to re-encode the whole track.  On a three-hour film that
is ten minutes of work and the loss of the 5.1 mix, to correct about two
seconds of audio: measured on a real Channel 4 recording, 83 frames out of
415,649 were the minority configuration - 0.02%.

This repairs those runs instead.  Frames in the dominant configuration are
passed through untouched, byte for byte; only the minority runs are decoded,
upmixed and re-encoded, and they are spliced back at the same frame positions
so nothing after them moves.

Two things make that safe:

  * The encoder adds one frame (1024 samples) of priming.  Measured against
    the original at a correlation of 0.9997 once dropped, so discarding the
    leading frame leaves the substitution sample-aligned and the frame count
    exactly preserved.
  * The replacement bitrate is measured from the cut's own dominant frames
    rather than guessed, so it matches what the broadcaster actually sent.

Frames are streamed rather than held: a run is buffered, repaired and written,
so peak memory is one run and not one audio track.
