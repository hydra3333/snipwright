"""The watcher engine: find new recordings, detect the adverts, write a .vprj.

Deliberately free of any Qt or UI code so it can be unit-tested headlessly and
reused.  A standalone tray app drives it on a timer; it could equally be driven
from a cron-style one-shot.  This is why the Chalkline entry point it calls
lives in chalkline.py rather than in chalkline_worker.py, which imports Qt.

For each recording it finds that it hasn't already handled and that has
finished recording, it runs the chosen detector - Chalkline or Comskip - to
find the commercials and writes a .vprj of those cuts into the output folder.
Which one runs is the editor's setting, not a separate one here: a recording
should not be detected one way unattended and another way by hand.  It never
edits or exports the recording - the produced project is a starting point the
user reviews and confirms in the editor (via the Batch Manager) before
anything is cut.

    recording; genuine failures are returned as result.error.
