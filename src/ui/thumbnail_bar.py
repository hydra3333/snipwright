"""
ThumbnailBar - the strip of frame thumbnails beneath the preview.

Behaviour:
  - Thumbnails are a fixed size (~120px).  The number shown is computed from
    the available width, so the strip fills the window and re-flows on resize.
  - The count is always odd, so the cursor frame sits in the dead centre.
    Near the start/end of the file the off-the-edge slots show blank, so the
    cursor stays centred rather than drifting.
  - A pixmap cache keyed by frame index means stepping one frame only decodes
    the single newly-revealed thumbnail; the other ten are reused.  Frames are
    fetched in increasing index order so the decoder stays on its fast
    sequential path.

The bar reads frames from window.frames (the FrameSequence) exactly as before,
so it works for both the in-RAM and decode-on-demand back ends.
