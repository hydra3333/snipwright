"""The remembered-logos manager: what Chalkline has learned, per channel.

Chalkline files each learned logo under the channel key it read from the
recording, and the two PVRs give different kinds of key for the same channel:
Tvheadend keeps the SDT so a service *name* survives, Jellyfin keeps the PAT
so a service *id* survives, and neither recording ever carries both - see
channel_key() in chalkline.py.  Nothing in Snipwright can resolve one to the
other, which is why the pairing is typed in here by hand rather than worked
out.  It is the only route there is.

A row is one channel.  Most rows are a learned logo; a channel with no logo
but a learned break ident (Film4, item 1y) gets a row from the card store
instead, so it can be named and paired like any other.  The Channel and
Service ID columns are both lookup keys for that same channel, so filling in
the empty half of a row makes what was learned work for recordings from the
other PVR too.  Typing a key that already has a row of its own merges the
two.

The Learn column switches learning off per channel (item 1x): what was
learned is still used to detect breaks, but correcting a project on that
channel no longer spends minutes decoding it to learn again.

The mask itself is drawn rather than described.  A learned logo looks like a
logo; a mask learned from a poor edit looks like scattered noise or a
fragment of a caption, and no number conveys that as quickly as the shape
does.
