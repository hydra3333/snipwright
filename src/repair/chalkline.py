"""Chalkline - the native advert detector for Snipwright.

Named for the tool a wright snaps across timber to mark where the cut goes.
That is what this does: it marks where the breaks are, it does not cut
anything.

The aim is a detector that needs no compilation, no per-channel configuration
and no tuning by the user, and which fails by finding nothing rather than by
inventing breaks.  A missed break costs the user a manual pass; an invented
break silently removes programme, which is unrecoverable once exported.

DESIGN
------
Two techniques each propose a *bracket* around a suspected break, and the
instant signals then place the edges precisely inside that bracket.

  Logo      A break is a stretch with no channel logo.  Measured against the
            hand-corrected corpus, the logo-off region reliably contains the
            true break with margin at both ends: 6.5 to 11.6 seconds early at
            the start, 6.0 to 16.0 seconds late at the end.  The overshoot is
            near-constant within a recording (5USA: -11.30, -11.59, -11.36;
            Legend: -8.46, -8.40, -8.09), so the logo is an excellent bracket
            but a poor edge.

  Aspect    A break is a stretch whose picture shape differs from the
            programme's.  Where it applies this is the most accurate signal
            available - start errors of -0.36s three times running on ITV4 and
            -0.90s three times on Sky Mix, which is better than Comskip's own
            output on the same files.

Neither is sufficient alone and neither is a property of the channel:

    5USA     logo only        adverts and programme are both 16:9
    ITV4     both             aspect is the more accurate
    Legend   both             aspect is the more accurate
    Sky Mix  aspect only      no logo Comskip or this detector can find
    U&Dave   logo only
    BBC One  neither          correctly reports nothing

This is why per-channel profiles are the wrong answer.  Sky Mix alone needs
aspect for a 4:3 archive programme and the logo for a 16:9 one, so a "Sky Mix
profile" would be wrong half the time.  The techniques are tried per recording
and whichever fits wins.

A third technique exists purely as a fallback, for a recording neither of
these can say anything about - Grimm, 16:9 throughout with no logo either
technique can find.  It brackets from the density of black/silence/scene
coincidence events inside a candidate span rather than from a picture
property, and it is engaged only when shape and logo both propose nothing at
all, so it can never compete with or distort a recording either of them
already handles.  Checked against the corpus: BBC One and a second
no-advertising recording (BBC Three) both stay silent, and the other four
corpus recordings cannot be reached by this at all since shape or logo
already proposes brackets on every one of them.  See coincidence_brackets()
for the reasoning.

A fourth technique, sample aspect ratio, is not a fallback at all: it is
tried on every recording, the same as shape and logo, because the case it
exists for is different in kind - a recording where the existing
techniques already propose brackets, just wrong ones.  Some broadcasters
change a recording's declared pixel aspect ratio between programme and
advert without changing the decoded picture at all, which shape cannot see
by construction: the analysis frames are decoded at a fixed size that
discards source SAR before shape_track() ever runs.  Single-recording
validation only, prototyped and not yet checked against the rest of the
corpus - see sar_brackets() and CLAUDE.md, "Measured: SAR change...".

A fifth technique, programme anchors, does not propose break brackets at
all - it proposes the opposite, and derives breaks from the gaps.  Every
other technique here assembles a break directly from whatever evidence it
finds and, where more than one candidate overlaps, `build_breaks()` picks
the single highest-evidence one and discards the rest - which fails when a
real break's own evidence arrives in more than one piece, since an advert
break's content is heterogeneous (several different adverts, no signal
consistent throughout all of them) and easily fragments.  This is Comskip's
own strategy, not one invented here - see CLAUDE.md, "Comskip comparison" -
adapted to this file's own shape signal: find long, confident runs where
the picture matches the programme's own dominant shape, and report every
gap between two consecutive runs as one whole break, however fragmented the
evidence inside that gap would otherwise look.  A film's aspect ratio is
consistent throughout, which makes confident programme a genuinely easier
thing to anchor on than the heterogeneous content sitting in between.
Validated across all four ITV1 films in the corpus - see anchor_gaps().

MEMORY
------
The analysis frames are held as uint8 in a disk-backed memmap and reduced in
chunks.  An earlier version converted the whole array to float32 and took two
int16 gradient copies of it, which is over 1.5GB on an hour of video and hung
the machine it was running on.  Nothing here may hold more than one chunk in
float at a time.

# a genuine change of content at the end has nothing on the far side to have
# overshot into.  That exemption is right and stays - but it was UNBOUNDED,
# and on 5star the corner search proposed "logo absent from 0.00 to 1995.00"
# on a 2581s recording.  It touched time zero, so the ceiling did not apply,
# and the detector reported one 33-minute break that removed all 25.2 minutes
# of programme and kept nothing but tail padding.  Its sibling bracket, the
# same span starting at 295s, was correctly dropped as "over 420s and not at
# an edge" - the exemption was the only thing that let the bad one through.
#
# score() called that detection "found 1/1, false 0": the giant bracket
# overlapped the one real advert, and nothing survived to count as a false
# positive.  A detector that deletes the programme must not be able to report
# a clean sheet, which is why this is a hard floor on the OUTPUT rather than
# another piece of evidence to be weighed.
#
# 0.50 sits in a wide flat band, not on a tuned edge.  Across the ten
# boundary-exempt brackets in run 21 the nine legitimate ones take 5.4% to

# between roughly 35% and 70% gives the same answer on all ten.  A figure
# chosen inside a gap that wide is not carrying the result - see
# MASK_POLARITY_MIN for the same reasoning.
#
# This is a guard against catastrophe, not a tuned parameter.  It treats the
# symptom: the root cause on 5star is the corner search preferring a corner
# the logo is on 31.5% of the time to one it is on 71.4% of the time, which
# is a separate question and still open.

# corpus never contained and which MIN_BREAK therefore discards - the logo
# pass proposed five brackets on one recording and only two survived.
#
# Lowering MIN_BREAK itself would widen every technique's exposure to brief

#
# A corner on for only a third is not a logo dropping through breaks.  On
# 5star it was a QR CODE, sitting bottom-right through the 10.6-minute
# infomercial that follows the programme.  The user spotted it in the
# recording; the arithmetic confirms it exactly.  The QR code is present for
# the trailing infomercial and absent for the programme, so the corner
# search - which assumes what it tracks is ON during programme and OFF
# during breaks - read it precisely backwards.  Its "logo absent" bracket,
# 0.00 to 1995.00, is the programme itself: the programme ends at 1943.28,
# a difference of 52 seconds.  Cutting that "break" removed the show.

# So the failure is not a marginal logo but an INVERTED one, and the
# on-fraction is what tells them apart: a real DOG is on for the programme,

# recording, where a 234px cluster of ordinary picture detail beat the real
# 58px logo on size alone.  Nothing here reinstates size as a criterion,

    cuts the advert break and stops there, because from then on the logo says
    "programme" - which leaves seven to ten minutes of continuity on the end
    of a trimmed recording, the user-visible half of item 1e.

    The logo finds the junction accurately (within a few seconds on 11 of the
    16 corpus recordings measured), so its START is kept exactly as it is.
    What the logo cannot say is that everything AFTER the break is continuity
    too.  A shape or SAR bracket that begins at that same junction and runs
    to the end of the recording does say it: the picture's shape changed when

    often cut in pieces - itv1-4's is 9237-9304 and 9334-9557 - and the last

    from ffmpeg's normal logging - `out_time_ms` against the known
    duration is what turns that into a percentage.  Popen rather than
    subprocess.run(), because a report printed only after the process exits
    is the same silence this exists to fix.

    stdout and stderr are merged and read as one stream, continuously,
    rather than reading stdout in the loop and deferring stderr to the end
    the way an earlier version of this function did.  That earlier version
    deadlocked for real on a recording whose decode produced enough
    repeated warnings to fill the OS pipe buffer on stderr - nothing was
    draining it while the loop waited on stdout, so the child blocked
    trying to write and the loop blocked waiting to read, forever.
    Reproduced directly with a stand-in process that writes 20,000 lines to
    stderr: the old shape hung indefinitely, needing an external `timeout`
    to kill it; reading both streams as one completed the same case in
    0.14s.  `-nostats`/`-loglevel error` on the caller's cmd reduce the
    volume but do not bound it, so they are not a fix on their own -
    genuinely messy broadcast material is exactly the case that produces
    unbounded warnings.

    Returns everything that was not a progress line, which is what
    video_signals() and audio_signals() need to parse for their
    black/scene and silence output.

    `progress_cb(percent, label)` replaces the stderr report when given, so
    the GUI can drive a progress bar off the same figures the command line
    prints.  `cancel_cb()` is polled on every line; returning True terminates
    ffmpeg and raises ChalklineCancelled.  Both default to None, which leaves
    the command-line behaviour exactly as it was.

    graph, no audio gives frames byte-identical to the two-pass pipeline,

    difference of 21.09/255 with 22.9% of pixels over 30 - the same signature

    Previously two full decodes of the same video: instant_signals() for the
    black and scene events, analysis_frames() for the 160x90 frames.  One
    decode now feeds both through a split - blackdetect and scene selection
    on one branch, fps/scale on the other.

    These events do not propose breaks - on their own they fire constantly,
    at every inter-advert gap as much as at a break edge.  They exist to
    place an edge precisely once a technique has said roughly where to look.

    THE DECODE MERGE, REVERTED TWICE BEFORE THIS.  The first attempt mapped
    audio with a bare `-map 0:a`, which maps every audio stream rather than
    one, and broke BBC One.  The second fixed that but produced analysis
    frames that were genuinely misaligned - mean 24/255, a quarter of pixels
    over 30/255 - and moved u&dave's end edge by 36.82s.  That was blamed on
    ffmpeg's fps filter choosing a different sampling phase downstream of a
    split.

    That diagnosis was wrong, and the reason it stood for so long is worth
    remembering: the merged pass was compared against analysis_frames, and
    the two differed in TWO ways at once - the split, and the presence of an
    audio output.  Only the split was suspected.  Isolating them shows the
    split is innocent and the audio output is not; see audio_signals(), which
    is why silencedetect now runs on its own.

    With audio out of the way this is byte-identical to the two-pass output
    on 15 of the 18 corpus recordings.  The three that differ - itv1-2,
    itv1-3, itv1-4 - are damaged streams, all reporting "non-existing PPS 0
    referenced" and "decode_slice_header error", and they are not
    byte-reproducible against *themselves*: running the OLD pipeline twice on
    itv1-2 gives different bytes too.  Multithreaded H.264 error concealment
    is not deterministic, and `-threads 1` makes both paths agree exactly.
    The residual difference is mean 0.00/255, against 23.91/255 for the fault
    that caused the revert, and corpus runs 16, 17 and 18 all produced
    identical scores for those three recordings while it was present.

    Scene events are written to a temp file rather than piped through stdout,
    which is where -progress reports; the two would otherwise interleave into
    one unparseable stream.

    Frames come back as a read-only memmap so nothing here is obliged to hold
    the whole recording in memory.

    stricter evidence test than the rest: both refined edges must show

    Brackets compete rather than merge.  The same break is often proposed

    candidate - picture noise misread as a change that never actually ends -
    not a genuine, permanent change in content with nothing on the far side
    of it to have overshot into.  Confirmed directly on itv1-4: the film
    ends and something else follows for the rest of the recording - what,
    is not this detector's business to know or assume, see
    programme_anchors() and anchor_gaps() for the same principle applied to
    what counts as a candidate in the first place.  shape found the

    826s long, and was discarded by the length ceiling alone - with nothing
    else to compete with it, a mask candidate 97 seconds later won instead,
    and the whole tail was kept as if it were still the film.

    `analysis_end` deliberately means the last timestamp this detector
    actually looked at (`times[-1]` in detect(), i.e. `(n-1)/FPS` for the n
    analysis frames decoded) - not the recording's probed container
    duration, which is a different number measured a different way and is
    not guaranteed to agree with it.  The first version of this fix used
    the probed duration and silently failed on the very file it was
    written for: shape's raw bracket is bounded by the analysis grid's own
    last sample, but the container duration ffprobe reports can sit more
    than a second beyond that for a real broadcast recording, so the
    at-edge check evaluated false and the fix never engaged.  Confirmed by
    running the real fix against a real corpus batch and watching it not
    change itv1-4's output at all before this was caught.  Compare against
    the same reference the brackets themselves are built from, not a
    second, independent measurement of "how long is this file".

    The 1.0s tolerance is for ordinary frame-boundary rounding, not a real

    For a recording neither shape nor logo can say anything about.  Grimm is

    usable logo has been found either by the corner search or by a
    remembered mask.  Both established techniques correctly report nothing -
    but nothing is the wrong answer here, because three real breaks exist.

    What is left is the black/silence/scene coincidence events themselves.
    Pairing every "strong" one - a black interval with a silence overlapping
    it, see COINCIDENCE_STRONG - with the next in length bounds finds the
    three real breaks, but also finds spans of ordinary programme that
    happen to sit the right distance apart: 217.77-462.99, and worse,
    1099.53-1516.59 - the gap between two real breaks, which naive pairing
    reads as a candidate in its own right because it is within MIN_BREAK and
    MAX_BREAK exactly as a break would be.

    The distinction is what happens *inside* the candidate.  A real break is
    a string of separate adverts, and the join between one advert and the
    next keeps tripping the same detectors that mark the break's own edges -
    just not quite hard enough to pass the "strong" bar itself.  A stretch of
    programme rarely does this more than once or twice, dialogue pauses
    aside.  Measured on Grimm, the interior score per second is 0.076-0.107
    for the three real breaks and 0.063 or below for every false candidate a
    naive pairing produces - a clean gap.  Checked afterwards against the
    corpus: BBC One and a second no-advertising recording (BBC Three) both
    stay silent, and the other four corpus recordings cannot be reached by
    this at all, since shape or logo already proposes brackets on every one
    of them before this is ever invoked.

    This must never be allowed to compete with shape or logo.  It is invoked
    only when neither of them proposes anything at all - see detect() -
    specifically so it can never distort a recording either technique
    already handles correctly.  Brackets are returned at full support, the
    same as shape: there is no multi-level agreement to score here the way
    logo_brackets() has, so a candidate that has already cleared the density
    gate is not weighed against anything weaker.

    Isolation is load-bearing and must not be optimised away.  Probing the
    source with `ffprobe -read_intervals` gives a *false negative* across a
    real break boundary - a clean, constant reading where the ratio actually
    changes; see CLAUDE.md, "Fixed: a fourth technique".  The value only
    differs once the moment is extracted into its own small file, with no
    seeking involved in the probe itself.  Two processes a sample is the
    price of a reading that can be trusted.

    `N/A` and zero-valued ratios are ffprobe saying it does not know.  They
    are passed through rather than filtered, deliberately.

    Filtering them was tried and reverted.  It looked obviously right - a
    reading that means nothing should not become a SAR *state* - and it did
    remove three spurious brackets sitting in plain programme (itv1
    2390-2470, skymix2 1380-1460, tptv-2 1610-1690, the last of which was a
    scored false positive).  But measured across the corpus it also erodes
    real ones: it deleted legend's 1340-1460 entirely, which sits inside a
    genuine break at 1259-1556, and moved tptv's first bracket from 970 to
    980 against a truth of 972.24, taking that recording from 7.88s to
    11.23s mean.

    The reason appears to be that `N/A` is not noise.  A one-second clip
    spanning a stream discontinuity cannot report a ratio - and
    discontinuities happen at junctions, which is exactly where breaks
    begin and end.  So these readings mark real edges as well as scattering
    through programme, and suppressing them costs signal.  Whether that can
    be exploited deliberately is an open question; suppressing it blindly is
    not the answer.

    video_signals(), already a full decode in its own right.  Frame-level
    ffprobe output requires the same decode work that pass does; there is no
    cheaper way to read it per
    frame.

    But per-frame precision was never needed.  Every real break in the
    corpus runs well over a minute, so a transition sampled every ten
    seconds is still caught with several samples to spare, and the

    technique's raw bracket, the same way a corner or shape bracket's own
    six-to-twelve-second overshoot already gets corrected. Sampling this
    sparsely turns an unavoidable full decode into a few hundred near-instant
    stream-copy extractions instead.

    Each sample extracts a one-second, stream-copied (not re-encoded) clip
    with ffmpeg's own `-ss` seeking - copying packets costs nothing like
    decoding them - and reads that tiny clip's own declared SAR fresh, the

    different sample aspect ratio from its programme - 24:17 (4:3) against
    32:17 (16:9) - on an unchanging pixel grid throughout.  Nothing in the
    decoded picture itself differs: no letterbox or pillarbox bar appears in
    either state, confirmed both by eye and by extracting the actual pixels
    and reading their size.  shape_track() cannot see this by construction,
    since video_signals() decodes at a fixed size that discards source SAR
    before shape_track() ever runs - this is a real blind spot in that
    technique, not a tuning gap.

    Scored on the one recording this exists for: found 3/3, false 0, 6/6
    edges within 5s, mean 1.10s in isolation - against the corner search's
    18.55s on the same file.  `merge_gap` defaults to 20s rather than
    runs_of()'s usual 8s, because sar_track() samples every 10s rather
    than every frame - at the default gap, every consecutive sample of the
    same run would look like its own isolated one-sample span, since the
    ordinary spacing between samples already exceeds it.  This still holds
    now that sar_track() sweeps coarsely and refines: every non-dominant
    sample falls inside a refined span, so the ones this function actually
    looks at are always 10s apart.  20s comfortably
    bridges consecutive same-state samples while staying far short of any
    real break's length, so it cannot bridge across a genuine gap between
    two separate breaks.

    Gated on shape, and on nothing else.  It is *not* gated the way
    coincidence_brackets() is: gating behind "brackets is empty" would never
    reach Talking Pictures TV's own failure, since the corner search
    proposes fifteen brackets there - just badly wrong ones.  The case this
    exists for is a recording where the existing techniques propose
    brackets, only the wrong ones.

    But it is a fallback for *shape* specifically, because shape's blindness
    to it is the whole reason it exists (see above).  When shape proposes
    brackets it is not blind, both techniques are reading the same 4:3/16:9
    switch, and this one adds nothing: measured on itv1, legend, more4,
    rewindtv and skymix, each of which proposes shape brackets, proposes
    exactly one SAR bracket, and scores identically with that bracket
    removed.  All three TPTV recordings propose no shape brackets at all.

    That gate matters because this is the only technique with a decode pass
    of its own - 154s on itv1-3, 21% of that recording's runtime - earning
    its keep on three recordings out of eighteen.

    Single-recording validation only.  Not yet checked against the rest of
    the corpus - see CLAUDE.md, "Measured: SAR change..." - and BBC One is
    the load-bearing test, as it always is for a new technique: a

def anchor_gaps(anchors):
    """Every gap between two consecutive programme anchors is one whole
    break candidate, however fragmented the evidence inside it would
    otherwise look to the other techniques.

    This is what lets a break survive being internally heterogeneous.
    `build_breaks()` still refines each gap's edges against real
    black/silence/scene evidence and still competes it against whatever
    shape, logo, mask and SAR propose directly for the same span - this
    only changes what gets offered into that competition, not how the
    competition itself is judged.

    Validated standalone against all four ITV1 films in the corpus before
    being wired into `detect()` at all:

        itv1     found 6/6, false 0, mean  1.84s (was 5/6, false 2, 33.19s)
        itv1-2   found 5/5, false 0, mean  1.33s (was 5/5, false 0,  8.91s)
        itv1-3   found 5/5, false 0, mean  1.62s (was 4/5, false 3, 28.65s)
        itv1-4   found 5/5, false 0, mean  1.20s (was 5/5, false 0, 12.69s)

    That validation was not enough on its own.  Wired in as a plain peer
    bracket source with full support, itv1-2/3/4 came back **completely
    unchanged** from the figures above the "was" - the anchor brackets were
    computed correctly and simply lost `build_breaks()`'s evidence
    competition every time they overlapped a shape bracket for the same
    span, because a narrow, wrong shape fragment's own edges often coincide
    with locally stronger black/silence/scene evidence than a wide, correct
    anchor's edges do.  Confirmed directly with a bracket trace on itv1-3:
    the anchor's refined edges were the accurate ones in both problem
    windows and lost anyway, 3.10 evidence against a wrong fragment's 3.50,
    2.60 against 3.00.

    The actual fix lives in `detect()`, not here: any shape bracket an
    anchor overlaps is suppressed before the competing pool is built,
    since it is derived from the same shape_track() measurement and is a
    fragment of the same signal the anchor already resolved completely,
    not independent evidence.  With that in place, real, in-pipeline
    results:

        itv1-2   found 5/5, false 0, mean 1.33s  (matches standalone)
        itv1-3   found 5/5, false 0, mean 1.62s  (matches standalone)
        itv1-4   found 5/5, false 0, mean 8.44s  (improved from 12.69s,
                                                   short of standalone's
                                                   1.20s at first - one
                                                   edge still unresolved)

    That itv1-4 gap was chased down, not left open.  `corner None` in the
    verbose log meant this file leans entirely on a remembered mask (ITV1's
    own 5px persistent one) via the gap-filling path, and the shape-vs-
    anchor suppression above never touches mask brackets at all.  A trace
    on the specific window showed the same mechanism again, one technique
    over: the mask's bracket was truncated 72s short of the true end by a
    brief false "logo present" reading - an unrelated advert's own logo
    happened to sit in the same screen position ITV1's mask tracks - and
    the truncated, wrong bracket (evidence 2.00) still beat the anchor's
    accurate, complete one (evidence 1.60).  Suppressing mask brackets an
    anchor overlaps too, the same principle applied to a second technique,
    closed it exactly: itv1-4 now reaches `found 5/5, false 0, 10/10 edges
    within 5s, mean 1.20s`, matching the standalone figure precisely.
    Confirmed harmless on the other two mask-using channels (5USA, U&Dave)
    with a full corpus batch - neither forms any anchors at all, so neither
    could have been touched by this regardless.

    Confirmed harmless everywhere shape currently contributes nothing at
    all (5USA, Channel 4, U&Dave, Talking Pictures TV: zero anchor
    brackets) and byte-identical everywhere shape already worked well
    alone (ITV4 1.11s, Legend 0.51s, Sky Mix 0.39s - unchanged to two
    decimal places, the safety check that mattered most since this is
    exactly where shape and anchor overlap). BBC One - the load-bearing
    test, as always - forms one giant anchor spanning the entire recording
    and proposes nothing.  See CLAUDE.md, "Fixed: a fifth technique -
    programme anchors", for the full story including both mistakes.

# Remembering a channel's logo
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The logo on some channels is not a presence signal at all.  On Sky Mix it
# appears for a few seconds at the start of each programme segment and then
# goes, so "logo absent" describes most of the programme as well as all of the
# break, and bracketing on it is meaningless.  What it does mark, very
# precisely, is where a break ends: on one recording the four segment starts
# were caught within 0.06, 0.18, 0.20 and 0.28 seconds.
#
# Finding it per-recording is the hard part, because a plain "are there edges
# in this corner" test cannot tell a logo from an advert's caption - measured
# on one advert, the corner lit up to 0.49 while the logo's own pixels only
# reached 0.16.  Matching the logo's *shape* separates them completely: the
# same test against a known mask gives 0.99 for the logo and 0.16 for the
# advert.
#
# So the mask is worth remembering.  It is stored against the channel, in
# coordinates relative to the active picture rather than to the frame,
# because the same logo sits in different places depending on what shape the
# picture is: on Sky Mix's 16:9 recordings it is at x 7-17 of the frame, and
# on its pillarboxed 4:3 ones at x 21-36, having been pushed across by the
# bar.  A mask pinned to frame coordinates would be a mask for one channel in
# one aspect ratio, which is not what it claims to be.

    full of dark text on white reads identically to one full of white text on
    dark.  A channel DOG is light; the advert artwork that defeats the mask on
    U&Dave is dark.  See MASK_POLARITY_GATE.

    Raw 0-255 levels, not normalised, so a value reads as "this many levels
    brighter than its surround".

    Costs one pass over the frames but no edge detection, so it is cheaper
    than mask_track() and can be computed beside it without a second decode.
    That is what lets the polarity gate be scored both ways from a single
    corpus run - see --polarity-ab.

    meant trim accuracy was never measured AT ALL, on any recording, in any
    batch run.  A whole class of defect was invisible: the U&Dave infomercial
    that two rounds of work have targeted lives entirely in the head trim, and
    the polarity gate's one clear success - taking u&dave2 from 121 seconds
    short to 0.26 - did not move a single number in the summary.

    Only the INNER edge of each padding region is scored.  A head trim runs
    from 0, and a tail trim to the end of the recording; those outer edges are
    right by construction and scoring them would dilute the figure with two
    guaranteed zeros per recording.  What is worth knowing is where the trim
    STOPS at the head, and where it STARTS at the tail.

    A padding region with no bracket OVERLAPPING it counts as missed rather
    than as an error of zero, because "trimmed nothing" and "trimmed
    perfectly" are opposite outcomes and averaging them together would hide
    the worse one.

    Candidates are found by OVERLAP with the padding region, not by starting
    within PADDING_TOLERANCE of the recording's edge.  The first version of
    this did the latter and was badly wrong: refine_edge() snaps a bracket's
    outer edge to the nearest black frame or silence, which on a real
    recording is typically several seconds in - itv1-3 refined to 6.59,
    itv1-4 to 11.91, more4 to 14.83, itv4 to 19.58.  All four had their head
    trimmed correctly and all four were scored "never cut", which made the
    detector look as though it ignored padding on three quarters of the
