"""One way in to every project format.

Snipwright reads and writes three kinds of project: its own (.swproj), a
VideoReDo project (.vprj) and a plain EDL cut list (.edl). The first two can
name their own recording and so work anywhere a project is used - Save
Project, the Watcher, the batch queue, opening from a file manager. An EDL
cannot, so it stays an Import and Save As choice only, never the default.

Callers go through this module rather than project.vprj or project.swproj
directly, so each place that handles a project changes by a line rather than
learning about every format itself. The format is decided by the file's
extension on the way in, and by the user's setting (or the extension they
chose) on the way out.
