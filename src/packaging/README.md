# Installing Snipwright

Two one-step installers set everything up (dependencies, a virtual environment,
and menu/desktop shortcuts).  Run the one for your platform.

## Linux (Debian / Ubuntu / Mint)

```sh
cd src/packaging
chmod +x install-linux.sh          # first time only
./install-linux.sh
```

It installs the system packages Snipwright needs (Python, `python3-venv`,
ffmpeg, mkvmerge and the Qt runtime libraries) via apt — asking for sudo only
if something's missing — creates a virtual environment in the project root
(`.venv`) on Python 3.12, installs the Python dependencies into it, adds
**Snipwright** and **Snipwright Watcher** to your applications menu pointing at
that environment, and finally checks the installation imports cleanly.
Re-running it is safe (the venv is reused), and re-running it (or just
`install-desktop-entries.sh`) after moving the project updates the menu
entries' absolute paths.

The Qt runtime libraries matter on a fresh install: without `libxcb-cursor0`
(required by Qt 6.5+) the application starts and then dies without a window,
which is easy to mistake for a broken install.

## Windows 10 / 11

Right-click `install-windows.ps1` and choose **Run with PowerShell**, or:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File src\packaging\install-windows.ps1
```

It uses **winget** to install Python, ffmpeg and mkvmerge if they're missing,
creates the `.venv`, installs the Python dependencies, and makes a Start-menu
and Desktop shortcut (using the app icon) that launches without a console
window.  If ffmpeg/mkvmerge were just installed, a sign-out/in may be needed
before Snipwright detects them (see **Settings → External tools**).

At the end it **offers** - only offers; the answer is No unless you say
otherwise - to exclude Snipwright's own Python folder (`.venv`) from Windows
Defender. Defender checks every file Snipwright loads the first time it starts
after a reboot: in testing that first start took about 9 seconds, and about
5.5 with the exclusion. Later starts take about a second either way. The
trade-off is that Defender stops scanning that folder altogether. Only the
installer (through pip) puts files there, so the risk is small, but it is your
choice. It needs administrator permission, so Windows will ask; if your
antivirus is managed by an organisation it may not be allowed, and Snipwright
works the same either way. To undo it, run `Remove-MpPreference -ExclusionPath`
with the folder's path in PowerShell as administrator.

## Menu entries only (Linux)

`install-desktop-entries.sh` is the menu-integration step on its own — handy if
you manage the Python environment yourself.  `install-linux.sh` calls it for
you with the venv's interpreter.

```sh
./install-desktop-entries.sh                       # uses python3 from PATH
./install-desktop-entries.sh ../../.venv/bin/python   # or pin the venv's Python
```

It writes two `.desktop` files into `~/.local/share/applications/` with
absolute paths resolved from this checkout, so re-run it if you move the
project.  It also registers the editor as a handler for `.ts` and `.mkv`.
To remove them again, use the uninstaller below.

## Uninstalling

Each platform has an uninstaller beside its installer, which removes what the
installer set up and what Snipwright creates while it runs.

```sh
bash src/packaging/uninstall-linux.sh
```

On Windows, double-click `src\packaging\uninstall-windows.bat`.

It removes the menu entries or shortcuts, Snipwright's `.vprj` and `.swproj`
file types (on Windows only Snipwright's own entries - VideoReDo's are left
alone), the Watcher's start-on-login entry, Snipwright's cache and temporary
scratch files, and the project's `.venv`. On Windows it also offers to remove
the Defender exclusion, if one was added, and Windows asks for permission.

It **asks** before deleting two things:

- **Quick Stream Fix working copies** - temporary repaired copies of
  recordings, often several gigabytes each, which it lists first.
- **Your settings** - settings, output profiles, learned channel logos and
  break idents, the batch queue and the Watcher's settings, in
  `~/.config/snipwright`. Keep them if you might reinstall: Snipwright picks
  them up again, so it doesn't have to relearn your channels.

Every question comes before anything is removed, and it refuses to start while
Snipwright or its Watcher is running. It never touches recordings, exported
videos, project files or logs - log files kept in the settings folder stay even
if you delete your settings - and it leaves FFmpeg, MKVToolNix and Python
installed, since other software may use them.

If you have more than one copy of Snipwright, the menu entries, file types and
start-on-login entry belong to whichever copy installed them last. The
uninstaller leaves them alone if they point at a different copy, so removing an
old copy can't break the one you use.

It can't delete the folder it runs from, so the last step is yours: delete the
Snipwright folder once it has finished. It tells you which.

## Icons

`src/assets/app_icon.svg` is the master icon; `app_icon.ico` (multi-resolution,
16–256 px) is generated from it for Windows shortcuts, and `app_icon_256.png`
is a handy raster copy.  Autostarting the **Watcher** on login is handled from
the Watcher's own settings.
